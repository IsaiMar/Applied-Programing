Portafolios

This has what you created that makes you unique from other students.
My collecion of the software I create. This includes my experimentation with technology.

Use the scientific process

Portafolios include our research and its conclusion.
Doing this has the following results:

-Potential employers will understand the purpose and scope of our software, including the breadth of knowledge that we have regarding the subject.

-Other engineers can learn from our work and potentially collaborate with us on improvements.

-We can recall where we stopped our investigation so that later we can continue with our learning.
