# Overview

I made my second game in Unity. I am trying to learn Unity to eventually make VR applications. 

I made an infinite runner game. You are an adventurer that went to investigate some ruins, he discovered something he shouldn't have. And now he needs to escape the temple from the mummies before it's too late. I made it so you have a timer and the timer is your score. You basically need to dogde the mummies by jumping over them (jump with space bar).


I made this game to keep learning Unity. I learned how to make a Main menu and a Game over screen. I also learned mechanics like jumping and collision.

# Future Work

* I will fix the restart button and the exit button.
* I will change the mummies spawn rate and velocity.
* I will change the infinite mechanic to have it get out of the temple. So, there will be an ending scene like in Mario Bros.
