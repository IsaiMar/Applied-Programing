# Overview

This is a 2D first person shooter created in Unity.

The game is very simple. As soon as you start playing there will appear some targets, you shoot the targets to get points in your 
score. The goal is to get 10 points (shoot 10 targets).

This was my first Unity game and I made it to learn how to use Unity.

You can watch a Demo of my game here:
