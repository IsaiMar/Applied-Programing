# Overview

This is my first R project. In this project I analyzed a data set in R to find out if two values were correlated to each other. 

I want to know if the perceived corruption in a country affects the happiness of the people living in that country.
In this analysis I am using a [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/world-happiness-report) from kaggle  titled "World Happiness Report 2022". I will use the happiness score value in the data set, this value was taken from a national survey where people score their happiness from 0 (unhappiest) to 10 (happiest). I will also use the perceived corruption value which was taken from a different national survey that goes from 0 (less corrupt) to 10 (more corrupt).

# Data Analysis Results

Question:
Does perceived corruption affect the countries happiness score? 
Result: Yes

# Future Work

* I will make a different type of test since one of the dataset was not normally distributed and the other one was.
* I will analyse how the other values in the data set affect the happiness score.
* I will add make the study in a lower scale to just look at an individual country like the US.
