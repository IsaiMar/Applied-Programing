# Overview

This is a chatbot I made using python. I used the Chatterbot library, and the Chatterbot-corpus library. The Chatterbot contains the functions to create the chat bot and the chatterbot-corpus to get the libraries with the trainings.

I also made a a conversation function that asks the user's input and then answers with one of the predetermine responses. The conversation is exited by inputing "QUIT".

I made this program to learn about machine learning and how to make a chatbot in Python.
